# Style

- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
  * Names of types and protocols are `UpperCamelCase`. Everything else is `lowerCamelCase`.
  * Include all the words needed to avoid ambiguity.
  * Omit needless words.
  * Avoid abbreviations.
  * Name variables, parameters, and associated types according to their roles.  
  e.g. `var greeting = "Hello"`, _not_ `var string = "Hello"`
  * Name functions and methods according to their side-effects.
  * Uses of Boolean methods and properties should read as assertions about the receiver when the use is non-mutating.
  e.g. `x.isEmpty`, `line1.intersects( line2 )`
  
- Clamshell curly brackets
  
```
if let _ = textField.text where !textField.text.isEmpty
{
    print( "Non-empty textField" )
}
else
{
    print( "Empty textField" )
}
```

- Comments with empty ending line

```
// `Characters` view doesn't honor certain characters.
// Rather, it treats characters as they appear visually.
// `utf16` view honors all characters, regardless of visuals.
//
var count: Int
{
    return self.utf16.count
}
```
- Spacing between operators

```
func contains( find: String ) -> Bool
{
    return range( of: find ) != nil
}
```

- Use **tabs** in Xcode...(not spaces)
